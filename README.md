# Personal-Portfolio-Website
This project involved designing and developing a website to showcase my skills, experience, and projects. The website likely includes a professional summary, work experience, education, skills, and examples of my projects or accomplishments. I used web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Vite to build the website.
